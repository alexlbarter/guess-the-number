# A test project to practice using Git and Github

To practice and experiment with Git and Github, I'm creating a very simple guess the number game in Python.

### On the command line

I first created a version that runs on the command line. It's extremely simple and lightweight.

### GUI with tkinter

I am also in the process of creating a version that uses a GUI.
